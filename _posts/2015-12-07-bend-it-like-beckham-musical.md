My journey with this show began in 2012 when I auditioned to be in the first musical workshop. I continued to work in all three workshops over a span of 2 years and in 2014, I was offered the role of Mrs Chopra and also asked to understudy Mrs Bhamra. Receiving nominations for Best featured actress and Best understudy respectively with Broadway World in 2015\. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9acc1ad8-1eab-4bc8-a886-3963758b8a89.jpg)
